# 📊 Decent Work and Economic Growth - Hong Kong Spatial Analysis

This project explores the spatial distribution of economic activity, company presence, and household income across Hong Kong’s 18 administrative districts. Using GIS tools and statistical modeling, it examines how proximity to businesses and economic centers relates to the quality of employment and income levels, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 8: **Decent Work and Economic Growth**.

## 🔍 Overview

Hong Kong is a globally significant financial center with pronounced economic disparities across regions. This project uses publicly available geospatial and socioeconomic datasets to:

- Map GDP by administrative district  
- Analyze the distribution and clustering of companies  
- Examine household income variations  
- Visualize 2km buffers around major company locations to assess job accessibility

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Sources**:
  - [Esri China Open Data](https://opendata.esrichina.hk)
  - [CSDI Geoportal](https://portal.csdi.gov.hk)
  - [Sina Finance](https://www.163.com/dy/article/ICL6A7PM0546N0CO.html)

- **Technologies**:
  - ArcGIS / QGIS for geospatial analysis
  - Python (pandas, geopandas, matplotlib) for data preprocessing and visualization

- **Analytical Methods**:
  - Spatial joins & thematic mapping
  - Buffer zone creation (2km radius)
  - Statistical correlation between GDP, company count, and household income

## 📈 Key Findings

- High GDP and income are concentrated in Central & Western, Wan Chai, and Southern districts.
- These districts host the majority of corporate headquarters and high-income jobs.
- Residents within 2km of major companies are more likely to access "decent work" and higher wages.
- Significant regional disparities exist, suggesting a need for more balanced urban and economic planning.
